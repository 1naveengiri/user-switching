You'll be instantly logged out and logged in as your desired user. This is handy for test environments where you regularly log out and in between different accounts, or for administrators who need to switch between multiple accounts.\r\n\r\n### Features ###\r\n\r\n * Switch user: Instantly switch to any user account from the *Users* screen.\r\n * Switch back: Instantly switch back to your originating account.\r\n * Switch off: Log out of your account but retain the ability to instantly switch back in again.\r\n * It's completely secure (see the *Security* section below).\r\n * Compatible with WordPress, WordPress Multisite, BuddyPress and bbPress.\r\n\r\n### Security ###\r\n\r\n * Only users with the ability to edit other users can switch user accounts. By default this is only Administrators on single site installs, and Super Admins on Multisite installs.\r\n * Passwords are not (and cannot be) revealed.\r\n * Uses the cookie authentication system in WordPress when remembering the account(s) you've switched from and when switching back.\r\n * Implements the nonce security system in WordPress, meaning only those who intend to switch users can switch.\r\n * Full support for administration over SSL (if applicable).\r\n\r\n### Usage ###\r\n\r\n 1. Visit the *Users* menu in WordPress and you'll see a *Switch To* link next to each user.\r\n 2. Click this and you will immediately switch into that user account.\r\n 3. You can switch back to your originating account via the *Switch back* link on each dashboard screen or in your profile menu in the WordPress toolbar.\r\n\r\nSee the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions) for information about the *Switch Off* feature.\r\n\r\n### Translations Included ###\r\n\r\n * العربية (Arabic)\r\n * Български (Bulgarian)\r\n * 中文 (Chinese Simplified)\r\n * Hrvatski (Croatian)\r\n * Nederlands (Dutch)\r\n * Suomi (Finnish)\r\n * Français (French)\r\n * Deutsch (German)\r\n * Ελληνικά (Greek)\r\n * עִבְרִית (Hebrew)\r\n * Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)\r\n * Italiano (Italian)\r\n * 日本語 (Japanese)\r\n * Lietuvių kalba (Lithuanian)\r\n * Norsk bokmål (Norwegian)\r\n * فارسی (Persian)\r\n * Polski (Polish)\r\n * Português do Brasil (Brazilian Portuguese)\r\n * Română (Romanian)\r\n * Русский (Russian)\r\n * Slovenčina (Slovak)\r\n * Español (Spanish)\r\n * Türkçe (Turkish)\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n\r\nInstall this plugin directly from your WordPress dashboard:\r\n\r\n 1.

Activate the plugin.\r\n\r\n## Frequently Asked Questions ##\r\n\r\n### What does \"Switch off\" mean? ###\r\n\r\nSwitching off logs you out of your account but retains your user ID in an authentication cookie so you can switch straight back without having to log in again manually. It's akin to switching to no user, and being able to switch back.\r\n\r\nThe *Switch Off* link can be found in your profile menu in the WordPress toolbar. Once you've switched off you'll see a *Switch back* link in the footer of your site.\r\n\r\n### Does this plugin work with WordPress Multisite? ###\r\n\r\nYes, and you'll also be able to switch users from the Users screen in Network Admin.\r\n\r\n### Does this plugin work with BuddyPress? ###\r\n\r\nYes, and you'll also be able to switch users from member profile screens and the member listing screen.\r\n\r\n### Does this plugin work with bbPress? ###\r\n\r\nYes, and you'll also be able to switch users from member profile screens.\r\n\r\n### Does this work as a mu-plugin? ###\r\n\r\nYes, but you'll need to install `user-switching.php` into the root of your `mu-plugins` directory, not in the `user-switching` subdirectory. This is a restriction of WordPress.\r\n\r\n### What capability does a user need in order to switch accounts? ###\r\n\r\nA user needs the `edit_users` capability in order to switch user accounts. By default only Administrators have this capability, and with Multisite enabled only Super Admins have this capability.\r\n\r\n### Can regular admins on Multisite installs switch accounts? ###\r\n\r\nNo. This can be enabled though by installing the [User Switching for Regular Admins](https://github.com/johnbillion/user-switching-for-regular-admins) plugin.\r\n\r\n### Are any plugin hooks called when users switch accounts? ###\r\n\r\nYes. When a user switches to another account, the `switch_to_user` hook is called with the new and old user IDs passed as parameters.\r\n\r\nWhen a user switches back to their original account, the `switch_back_user` hook is called with the new (original) and old user IDs passed as parameters. Note that the old user ID can be boolean false if the user is switching back after they've been switched off.\r\n\r\nWhen a user switches off, the `switch_off_user` hook is called with the old user ID as a parameter.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
